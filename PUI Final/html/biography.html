            Kazimir Malevich, born on February 23, 1879, in Kiev, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire), was a prominent Russian avant-garde artist and a key figure in the development of abstract art in the early 20th century. Malevich's career includes his early involvement with Cubo-Futurism, which later evolved into his groundbreaking work in the Suprematist movement.
